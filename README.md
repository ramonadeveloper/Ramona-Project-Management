# Ramona-Project-Management with Waffle.io
Playing with Waffle.io and checking out some features.
Very cool because:  
- Easy interface
- You never have to manually track features.
- Easy to invite people and manage bug requests.
- Cool categorization of stuff - bug, enhancement, milestone.
Loving this!
